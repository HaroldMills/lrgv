The `lrgv` Python package is software for Old Bird acoustic monitoring
projects. It includes a *Nighthawk runner* that runs the Nighthawk
nocturnal flight call detector on audio recordings and a *clip archiver*
that adds detected clips to a Vesper archive. As of this writing, the
Nighthawk runner runs on monitoring station laptops, while the archiver
runs on a separate computer located near Ithaca, NY and dedicated to
maintaining the station laptops (to the extent possible via the SugarSync
file synchronization utility) and archiving their detections. In the future,
the archiver may run on the station laptops instead.

The name of this package is likely to change in the future. It was
originally named for the LRGV (Lower Rio Grande Valley) project, but
is now used for other projects as well.
